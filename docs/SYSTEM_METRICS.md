# GitFix System Metrics and Performance Tracking

## Overview

This document defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics for the GitFix automated issue processing system. These metrics help measure system effectiveness, identify improvement opportunities, and track the value delivered by AI-powered automation.

## Core Success Metrics

### 1. Issue Resolution Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of "AI"-tagged issues that are successfully implemented, tested, and merged without significant human rework.

**Calculation**: 
```
Issue Resolution Rate = (Successfully Merged PRs / Total AI-Tagged Issues Processed) × 100
```

**Target Values**:
- **Good**: > 70% - System effectively handles most issues
- **Acceptable**: 50-70% - System provides value but needs optimization
- **Needs Improvement**: < 50% - Significant prompt or system improvements required

**Tracking Method**: 
- Automatically logged in worker completion logs
- Weekly manual review of merged vs. created PRs
- Monthly trend analysis

### 2. Time-to-PR Metric

**Definition**: Average time from an issue being picked up by the daemon to a PR being created.

**Measurement Points**:
- **Start**: Issue labeled with "AI-processing" tag
- **End**: PR created and linked to the issue

**Target Values**:
- **Excellent**: < 10 minutes
- **Good**: 10-30 minutes  
- **Acceptable**: 30-60 minutes
- **Needs Investigation**: > 60 minutes

**Components Tracked**:
- Git environment setup time
- Claude Code execution time
- Post-processing (commit/push/PR creation) time

### 3. Human Review Effort

**Definition**: Estimated time spent by human reviewers per AI-generated PR.

**Measurement Categories**:
- **Minimal Review** (< 15 minutes): Minor style issues, immediate approval
- **Standard Review** (15-45 minutes): Normal review process, minor feedback
- **Intensive Review** (45+ minutes): Major issues requiring significant analysis
- **Rejected/Rework** (varies): PRs requiring substantial changes

**Target Distribution**:
- Minimal: 40%+
- Standard: 45%
- Intensive: 10%
- Rejected: < 5%

**Tracking Method**: Manual categorization during PR review process

### 4. PR Acceptance Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of AI-generated PRs that are merged (with or without minor human tweaks).

**Categories**:
- **Direct Merge**: No changes required (target: 30%+)
- **Minor Tweaks**: Small changes before merge (target: 50%+)
- **Major Rework**: Significant changes required (target: < 15%)
- **Rejected**: PR closed without merge (target: < 5%)

**Calculation**:
```
PR Acceptance Rate = (Merged PRs / Total PRs Created) × 100
```

## Cost and Efficiency Metrics

### 5. Claude API Usage Tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Cost per successfully resolved issue
- Average tokens used per issue
- Cost per conversation turn
- Model usage distribution (if multiple models used)

**Data Source**: Claude Code execution logs and API response metadata

**Target Values**:
- Cost per successful issue: < $2.00 (adjust based on issue complexity)
- Token efficiency: Minimize tokens while maintaining quality

### 6. Resource Utilization

**Infrastructure Metrics**:
- Docker container execution time
- Git worktree creation/cleanup time
- Redis queue processing efficiency
- Worker process performance

**Target Values**:
- Container startup time: < 30 seconds
- Worktree operations: < 60 seconds total
- Queue processing latency: < 5 seconds

## Failure Analysis Metrics

### 7. Failure Categorization

Track and categorize reasons for system failures:

**AI-Related Failures**:
- `claude-comprehension`: AI misunderstood the issue requirements
- `claude-technical`: AI generated non-functional code
- `claude-scope`: AI exceeded or missed the intended scope
- `claude-timeout`: AI execution exceeded time limits

**Infrastructure Failures**:
- `git-error`: Git operations failed (clone, push, branch creation)
- `github-api`: GitHub API rate limits or connectivity issues
- `docker-failure`: Claude Code Docker container issues
- `queue-failure`: Redis or task queue problems

**Environment Failures**:
- `auth-failure`: GitHub authentication issues
- `permission-error`: File system or repository permission problems
- `network-timeout`: Network connectivity issues

**Target Distribution**:
- AI-Related: < 15% of total processed issues
- Infrastructure: < 5% of total processed issues
- Environment: < 3% of total processed issues

### 8. Retry and Recovery Metrics

**Metrics**:
- Success rate of retry attempts
- Common retry scenarios
- Time cost of retry operations

**Target Values**:
- Retry success rate: > 60%
- Average retry overhead: < 50% of original processing time

## Quality Metrics

### 9. Code Quality Indicators

**Automatically Trackable**:
- Lines of code changed per issue
- Number of files modified
- Test coverage impact (if measurable)

**Human Assessment** (collected during PR review):
- Code maintainability score (1-5 scale)
- Adherence to project standards (1-5 scale)
- Security consideration rating (1-5 scale)

### 10. User Satisfaction

**Issue Closer Feedback**:
- Satisfaction rating for resolved issues (1-5 scale)
- Feedback on solution quality
- Comments on review effort required

**Development Team Feedback**:

// Example metrics log entry
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "issueNumber": 123,
  "repository": "owner/repo",
  "correlationId": "abc-123-def",
  "processingTime": {
    "total": 450000,        // milliseconds
    "gitSetup": 60000,
    "claudeExecution": 300000,
    "postProcessing": 90000
  },
  "result": {
    "status": "complete_with_pr",
    "claudeSuccess": true,
    "prCreated": true,
    "prNumber": 456
  },
  "claudeMetrics": {
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet",
