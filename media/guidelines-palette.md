2. Wordmark ("GitFix" Text)

Font Family: A modern, clean, sans-serif typeface is recommended. A good starting point that closely matches the visual style would be:

Primary Recommendation: 'Inter' (a highly versatile open-source font)

Alternative: 'Montserrat', 'Source Sans Pro'

Font Weight: 'Medium' or 'SemiBold' to maintain readability without being overly thick. (e.g., Inter Medium 500 or Inter SemiBold 600)

Kerning/Tracking: Standard. Avoid overly tight or loose letter spacing.

4. Usage Guidelines

Clear Space: Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo (e.g., minimum height of the 'G' character on all sides) to ensure its legibility and impact.

Minimum Size: Ensure the logo is not reproduced at a size where the internal elements become indistinguishable or blurry.

Backgrounds: Prefer placement on white, light grey, or other light, neutral backgrounds to maximize contrast. If used on a dark background, inverse the colors (e.g., white diamond outline with red sparkle/nodes, and white "Git" with red "Fix").
